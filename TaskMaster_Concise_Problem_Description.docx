# TaskMaster: Advanced System Process Management Tool

## Detailed Description About the Problem:

Today's computing environments demand running numerous complex applications simultaneously, yet standard task managers provide only basic snapshots of current system activity without historical context. Users face significant challenges when troubleshooting performance issues, often resorting to guesswork when diagnosing intermittent problems that don't appear during manual observation.

Standard monitoring tools present system data in simplistic tables or basic graphs that fail to illustrate the relationships between CPU, memory, and disk usage. This makes identifying resource-intensive processes and understanding system behavior patterns nearly impossible for average users. Process management capabilities are equally limited, offering minimal control beyond starting and terminating applications.

The fragmentation of existing solutions compounds these issues â€“ users must juggle multiple tools for real-time monitoring, historical analysis, and process control. This disjointed approach creates inefficiencies and often results in important information being overlooked.

TaskMaster addresses these gaps by providing an integrated solution combining real-time monitoring with historical analysis, intuitive visualizations, and enhanced process management. By unifying these functions within a single interface, TaskMaster empowers users to understand system behavior holistically and optimize performance proactively.
