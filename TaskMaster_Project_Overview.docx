## API Usage

TaskMaster primarily uses Python libraries rather than external APIs. However, it does interface with several system-level APIs through its libraries:

1. **System Process API (via Psutil)**
   - **Purpose**: Interacts with the operating system's process management
   - **Integration**: The application uses psutil to access system processes, which internally uses platform-specific APIs
   - **Functions**:
     - Retrieves process information
     - Controls process execution (termination, priority)
     - Monitors system resources

2. **Database API (via SQLite3)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides a standardized interface to the SQLite database
   - **Integration**: The application uses Python's sqlite3 module to interact with the database
   - **Functions**:
     - Stores and retrieves process history
     - Manages database connections and transactions
     - Executes SQL queries for data analysis

3. **GUI API (via PyQt6)**
   - **Purpose**: Interfaces with the operating system's windowing system
   - **Integration**: The application uses PyQt6, which wraps Qt's C++ APIs
   - **Functions**:
     - Creates native-looking UI components
     - Handles user input and system events
     - Manages application windows and dialogs

## Basic Project Functionality

TaskMaster operates through several interconnected components:

1. **Process Monitoring**
   - The application continuously monitors system processes using a background thread
   - Process data is collected at regular intervals (every 5 seconds)
   - The UI is updated to reflect the current state of processes

2. **Data Storage**
   - Process and system data is periodically saved to an SQLite database
   - The database maintains historical records for trend analysis
   - Old data is automatically cleaned up to prevent excessive database growth

3. **User Interface**
   - The main window displays a table of the top processes by CPU usage
   - Additional dialogs provide detailed performance graphs and historical analysis
   - The UI is responsive and updates in real-time without blocking user interaction

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Historical data is analyzed using pandas to identify trends and patterns
   - Statistics are calculated for both individual processes and system-wide metrics
   - Analysis results are presented through charts and summary statistics
